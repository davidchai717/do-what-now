### What is this?

A light solution to pin the next task on your todo list to the menubar - which helps increase the visibility. I knew this would be extremely helpful for ADHD folks like me so I went ahead and created it.

### How to use

Mark any task of your choice as high priority, and the app will automatically detect it and pin it.

Very much a WIP still... Don't expect too much for the time being.
